# DICOM parser in Go
This is a fork of [go-dicom](https://github.com/gillesdemey/go-dicom) with commits from the grailbio [go-dicom repository](https://github.com/grailbio/go-dicom) applied on top. We will be augmenting this codebase to parse multi-frame enhanced CT images, and much more. 

### Acknowledgements (from the original go-dicom)

I'd like to thank my friend [Seppe Stas](https://github.com/Bitbored/) for helping me get through the horrific DICOM image specification and some of the harder parts of the parser.

Some more inspiration and helpful resource that brought this library to life (in no particular order):
